# UFOs

## Overview
This project was devised to help Dana, a data journalist, determine UFO sightings in an easy to read website that will support her upcoming article with a table that utilizes filters using ES6 and Javascript to query the data.


## Results
To get the most out of the acquired data we have built a customizable filtering system into the table. Anyone using the webpage can focus their search to drill down into sightings from specific...

### Dates...

### Cities...

### States...

### ...and shapes of observed phenomena.

The filters can also be combined to capture even more granular information such as all the sightings of unexplainable "light" phenomena on January 1st, 2010 in California. (See below)

<br/>I have also included the ability to search by country. However, that functionality will be included in future iterations as we continue to grow the dataset as only sightings from the United States are available at this time.
